# Introduction
  I've been working on this project recently, and I want to learn how to make a landing page for a university. However, I am terrible at designing websites. Maybe someone can help me design the web? and I haven't used any MVC yet. One more thing, I also use databases on source code; I don't know if they work or not if you download source code. Maybe you can give me some suggestions for this project.

# Technologies
* PHP v8.2.0
* MySQL v8.0.31

# Setup
* I use a web server to run this project (to run the database, of course, and I'm using WAMP).
* Download the source code and open it with VS code (or any code editor).

P.S
This project is still in the development stage.
