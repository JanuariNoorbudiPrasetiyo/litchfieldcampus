## Introduction
  I've been working on this project recently, and I want to learn how to make a landing page for a university. However, I am terrible at designing websites. Maybe someone can help me design the web? and I haven't used any MVC yet. One more thing, I also use databases on source code; I don't know if they work or not if you download source code. Maybe you can give me some suggestions for this project.

## Technologies
* PHP v8.2

## Setup
just downdload the source code and open it with VS code (or any code editor).
